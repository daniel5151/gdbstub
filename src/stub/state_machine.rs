//! Low-level state-machine interface that underpins [`GdbStub`].
//
// TODO: write some proper documentation + examples of how to interface with
// this API.
//!
//! # Hey, what gives? Where are all the docs!?
//!
//! Yep, sorry about that!
//!
//! `gdbstub` 0.6 turned out ot be a pretty massive release, and documenting
//! everything has proven to be a somewhat gargantuan task that's kept delaying
//! the release data further and further back...
//!
//! To avoid blocking the release any further, I've decided to leave this bit of
//! the API sparsely documented.
//!
//! If you're interested in using this API directly (e.g: to integrate `gdbstub`
//! into a `no_std` project, or to use `gdbstub` in a non-blocking manner
//! alongside `async/await` / a project specific event loop), your best bet
//! would be to review the following bits of code to get a feel for the API:
//!
//! - The implementation of [`GdbStub::run_blocking`]
//! - Implementations of [`BlockingEventLoop`] used alongside
//!   `GdbStub::run_blocking` (e.g: the in-tree `armv4t` / `armv4t_multicore`
//!   examples)
//! - Real-world projects using the API (see the repo's README.md)
//!
//! If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion thread over at the
//! [`gdbstub` GitHub repo](https://github.com/daniel5151/gdbstub/).
//!
