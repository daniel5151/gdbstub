/// Target Extension - Support for single-register access.
///
/// While this is an optional feature, it is **highly recommended** to
/// implement it when possible, as it can significantly improve performance
/// on certain architectures.
///
/// If this extension is not implemented, the GDB client will fall-back to
/// accessing _all_ registers, even in cases where it only requires knowing a
/// single register's value.
///
/// Moreover, certain architectures have registers that are not accessible as
/// part of the default default register file used by the `read/write_registers`
/// methods, and can only be accessed via this extension (e.g: the RISC-V
/// Control and Status registers).
