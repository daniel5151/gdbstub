    ///
    /// ### Adjusting PC after a breakpoint is hit
    ///
    /// The [GDB remote serial protocol documentation](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Stop-Reply-Packets.html#swbreak-stop-reason)
    /// notes the following:
    ///
    /// > On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level, when a
    /// > breakpoint instruction executes the program counter points at the
    /// > breakpoint address plus an offset. On such targets, the stub is
    /// > responsible for adjusting the PC to point back at the breakpoint
    /// > address.
    ///
    /// Omitting PC adjustment may result in unexpected execution flow and/or
    /// breakpoints not appearing to work correctly.
    ///
    /// ### Bare-Metal Targets
    ///
    /// On bare-metal targets (such as microcontrollers or emulators), it's
    /// common to treat individual _CPU cores_ as a separate "threads". e.g:
    /// in a dual-core system, [CPU0, CPU1] might be mapped to [TID1, TID2]
    /// (note that TIDs cannot be zero).

    /// relevant, as different cores may have different memory maps.
