//! Support for
//! [Tracepoint](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Tracepoints.html)
//! extensions.
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//!
//! Most fundamental tracepoint operations are supported, but there quite a few
//! packets / APIs that are not yet implemented, such as:
//!
//! - Fast Tracepoints
//! - Tracepoint Conditions
//! - Trace State Variables
//!
//! If you are interested in extending this API to support these additional
//! features, please consider opening an Issue / PR on the `gdbstub` GitHub
//! repo.
