/// A collection of methods and metadata a `GdbStub` can use to control and
/// debug a system.
///
/// There are several [provided methods](#provided-methods) that can optionally
/// be implemented to enable additional advanced GDB debugging functionality.
///
/// ### Handling Threads on Bare-Metal Hardware
///
/// On bare-metal targets (such as microcontrollers or emulators), it's common
/// to treat individual _CPU cores_ as a separate "threads". e.g: in a dual-core
/// system, [CPU0, CPU1] might be mapped to [TID1, TID2] (note that TIDs cannot
/// be zero).
///
/// ### What's with the `<Self::Arch as Arch>::` syntax?
///
/// Yeah, sorry about that!
///
/// If [rust-lang/rust#38078](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38078)
/// every gets fixed, `<Self::Arch as Arch>::Foo` will be simplified to just
/// `Self::Arch::Foo`.
///
/// Until then, when implementing `Target`, it's recommended to use the concrete
/// type directly. e.g: on a 32-bit platform, instead of writing `<Self::Arch
/// as Arch>::Usize`, use `u32` directly.
#[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
pub trait Target {
    /// The target's architecture.
    type Arch: Arch;

    /// A target-specific **fatal** error.
    type Error;

    /// Resume execution on the target.
    ///
    /// `actions` specifies how various threads should be resumed (i.e:
    /// single-step vs. resume). It is _guaranteed_ to contain at least one
    /// action.
    ///
    /// The `check_gdb_interrupt` callback can be invoked to check if GDB sent
    /// an Interrupt packet (i.e: the user pressed Ctrl-C). It's recommended to
    /// invoke this callback every-so-often while the system is running (e.g:
    /// every X cycles/milliseconds). Periodically checking for incoming
    /// interrupt packets is _not_ required, but it is _recommended_.
    ///
    /// # Implementation requirements
    ///
    /// These requirements cannot be satisfied by `gdbstub` internally, and must
    /// be handled on a per-target basis.
    ///
    /// ### Adjusting PC after a breakpoint is hit
    ///
    /// The [GDB remote serial protocol documentation](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Stop-Reply-Packets.html#swbreak-stop-reason)
    /// notes the following:
    ///
    /// > On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level, when a
    /// > breakpoint instruction executes the program counter points at the
    /// > breakpoint address plus an offset. On such targets, the stub is
    /// > responsible for adjusting the PC to point back at the breakpoint
    /// > address.
    ///
    /// Omitting PC adjustment may result in unexpected execution flow and/or
    /// breakpoints not appearing to work correctly.
    ///
    /// # Kinds of Targets
    ///
    /// ### Single-Threaded Targets
    ///
    /// For single-threaded Target's (i.e: those that have not implemented any
    /// (optional|multithreading) features), it's safe to ignore the
    /// `TidSelector` component of the `actions` iterator entirely. Moreover,
    /// it's safe to assume that there will only ever be a single `action`
    /// returned by the `actions` iterator. As such, the following snippet
    /// should never panic:
    ///
    /// `let (_, action) = actions.next().unwrap();`
    ///
    /// Lastly, when returning a `(Tid, StopReason)` pair, the
    /// [`gdbstub::SINGLE_THREAD_TID`](constant.SINGLE_THREAD_TID.html) constant
    /// should be used for the `Tid` field.
    ///
    /// ### Multi-Threaded Targets
    ///
    /// If a Target ever lists more than one thread as active in
    /// `list_active_threads`, `gdbstub` switches to multithreaded mode. In
    /// this mode, the `actions` iterator may return more than one `action`.
    ///
    /// At the moment, `gdbstub` only supports GDB's
    /// ["All-Stop" mode](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html),
    /// whereby _all_ threads should be stopped when returning from `resume`
    /// (not just the thread responsible for the `StopReason`).
    ///
    /// ### Bare-Metal Targets

    /// to use "threads" on bare-metal (threadless) targets to debug
